      I have finished economics honours in ANU in 2025,

      inequality studies, and econometrics. Passionate about careful data-driven 
      solutions that impact real-world policy.

    <h2>Research Projects</h2>
<p>
    My idea of good research is one that carefully combine economic theory, 
    mathematics, and empirical evidence.
    I value intuition in identifying questions that are socially and economically 
    meaningful, and I place strong emphasis on clear communication so that research
    remains connected to the wider community. These principles guide both my academic 
    training and professional work.
