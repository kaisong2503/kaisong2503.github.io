  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>
      I have finished economics honours in <a href="https://rse.anu.edu.au" target="_blank">RSE</a>,
    <a href="https://anu.edu.au" target="_blank">ANU</a> in 2025.
    I have strong interests in public and development economics, 
    inequality studies, and econometrics; at the same time passionate about careful data-driven 
    solutions that impact real-world policy.

    <h2>Research Projects</h2>
<p>
    My idea of good research is one that carefully combines economic theory,
    mathematics, and empirical evidence. I value intuition in identifying
    questions that are socially and economically meaningful, and I place 
    strong emphasis on clear communication so that research remains connected 
    to the wider community. These principles guide both my academic training 
    and professional experience.

      <h2>Teachings</h2>
      <p>
        I have experience as a teaching assistant for undergraduate introductory 
        and intermediate microeconomics at ANU. Through this experience, I have 
        learned to adapt my teaching to different learning styles while encouraging 
        students to think independently and communicate economic ideas clearly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like my perception of good research, my ideal way of teaching is grounded in the 
        integration of economic intuition, formal theory, and real-world examples.
        I aim to help students understand not only how models work, but why they matter. 
        I emphasise clarity, intuition, and active engagement before technical detail.

      <h2>Other Writings</h2>
      <p>
        I occasionally write things inspired by economics thinking that interest me. 
        These are not formal research papers, but rather explorations of topics 
        I find intriguing.

        I am (semi) commited to posting at least once a month on a plateform 
        called <a href="https://substack.com/about" target="_blank">Substack</a>.

      <h2>Personal</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy running, fitness, black coffee, and a fine craft beer. 
        In 2025, I completed my first marathon at the Canberra Marathon
        Festival. I aim at finishing a 
        <a href="https://www.hyrox.com/" target="_blank">HYROX</a> 
        soon!
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun fact: I had a presentation 
        coming up three days after the marathon, 
        so I ran the full 42 km while listning to
        <i>A Schumpeterian Model of Top Income Inequality </i> by
        <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/inequality.pdf" target="_blank"> Jones and Kim (2018)</a>. I scored the highest mark in that presentation.
