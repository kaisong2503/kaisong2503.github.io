      <h3>Optimal Intergenerational Sugar Tax: a Sufficient Statistics Approach</h3>
      <h4>Honours Thesis, Supervised by Dr. <a href="https://www.ashleycraig.com/" target="_blank"> Ash Craig</a></h4>
      <p>
        Completed in October 2025. The Honours thesis with the highest mark in the cohort.

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>
Sugar over-consumption induces health problems, and the sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB)
tax is debated worldwide. One of the motivations to tax SSB is “internality correction”:
correcting the over-consumption due to individual mistakes. Most existing models stop at
a single generation, treating the government as the only agent exercising the correction.
But in reality, parents are also correcting their children's behaviour: they provide food,
form habits, and care about their children's welfare. Ignoring parental correction, the SSB
tax may not be accurate. My thesis estimates the optimal SSB tax when considering the
intergenerational impact the parents have on the children, extending the single-generation
static tax to a multi-generation setting. I created a model where both the government and
parents intervene; the optimal sugar tax is more than just adjusting parameters. I derive
the sufficient statistics from the model to estimate the optimal SSB tax. I show empirically
that accounting for intergenerational effect, the optimal SSB tax is between 8.8% to 12.2%,
which is larger compared to the tax without intergenerational concern 5.4%.

      <h3>Decomposing the Gap: Tracing the Sources of Indigenous Income Inequality</h3>
      <h4>Project report, Supervised by Prof. <a href="https://rse.anu.edu.au/about/staff-directory/professor-bob-gregory" target="_blank"> Bob Gregory</a></h4>
        <p>
        Completed in October 2024. Part of coursework for Special topics in Economics.
      </p>
      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>
    The "Closing the Gap" plan aims to reduce inequality between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
    people and non-Indigenous Australians in terms of real-life outcomes. The plan targets key areas 
    such as health, education, and employment. This report focuses on average weekly income as an indicator 
    of socioeconomic opportunity, analysing the income gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians
    and tracing the sources of this inequality using publicly available Australian Census data in TableBuilder.
    I highlighted the importance of employment conditioned on education, the differences in such between Indigenous 
    and non-Indigenous Australians, and its impact on the income gap. I have also highlighted the possibility of 
    income inequality analysis without individual-level data
